Does that which are unable to see really exist? Without light, there is no perception of matter. It can be nothing, it can be anything. Here, Light quietly manifests its existence. Interestingly, it does so through the reverse phenomenon that it alone is able to produce: Shadow.

(Un)Balanced is an interactive installation, built with wood structure, in which two swings are suspended, connected by a circuit of strings that work together, shifting in vertical oscillatory motion according to the weight and force imposed by the users. There is a subversion of the typical swing that uses a pendulum movement to front and rear with individual function, for this proposal it acquires an up and down action that is dependent on the binomial relationship. 
The object has three definitions, 1) sculptural, with a minimalist elegance, 2) dynamic, providing fun, and 3) reflective of the relationship with the other. aims to be an analogy of human, social and political relations and as well a demonstration that balance only depends on the harmonious relationship between the parts.

Developed with Patrick Hubmann (designer) for the event “Happy Together 2016” organised by Mala Voadora for Forum of the Future. It was also presented in Porto Innovation Hub and event Second Chance.

It seeks to be a stopping point, a place of rest, of fruition, of a challenge, creating a new dynamizing pole within the circuit of the event.

A project aiming to merge two distinct creative fields – architecture+design and performing arts - into the creation of several pieces that define, through a mechanical and scenic artefact, a place and physical condition for the viewer in relation with the other spectators.
In the same way there is, in each piece, an instructive proposal that guides the way in which the situation will be experienced, considering the user simultaneously the visitor and the performative body of the work. It articulates the conception and design of various objects to the dramaturgy of a performance based on the creation of three mechanical artefacts inspired by notions of unstable movement aiming to motivate the reflection on balance, relations, forces, weights, dependencies, presupposing to establish action-reaction dynamics between at least two people.

Project in development in collaboration with Diogo Alvim (musician and composer), Lígia Soares (choreographer and playwright) and Rita Vilhena (performer, dancer and choreographer).

Technology is imprisoning our reality inside a digital world. And light is kept manipulated by us to fulfill our demands. This installation breaks the theme into two particular contexts: human communication and nature calling. Human communication is addressed mainly through the provocation of morse code via light signals, defying society with an outdated and subverted technological medium. The content within the context, on the other hand, will force ideas about life and nature, such as our respect for the planet, our desire to put a name and force equations to adapt to everything inside this little cosmos, and finally our abusive disguise of innovation and growth with ideas of progressivism. It is time for us to feel the nature and characteristics of what we conceive and create (the medium) by virtue of the changes that result from it (the message).
